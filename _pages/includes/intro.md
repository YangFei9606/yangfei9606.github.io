I was born in Harbin, Heilongjiang.
I received my bachelor's degree in Automation from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2018,
then I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from The University of Adelaide in 2022 with a Dean's Commendation on Doctoral Thesis Excellence.
I am now a Shui-Mu Pos-Doc Research Fellow at Tsinghua University, focusing on the application of control theory in intelligent transportation systems. 

My research interests include neural networks, intelligent control, real-time embedded systems, intelligent transportation systems and robotics. 
I am currently a highly self-cited researcher recognised by Google Scholar and Clarivate.
